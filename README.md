# Challenge 10, Mission to Mars - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Project Overview
We’ll build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We’ll also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

The goals of this challenge are to:

1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.


## Resources
- Software: VS Code (writing JavaScript)

# Summary
In this module, we built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We also created five filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it reacts to user inputs including date, city, state, country, and shape. The filtered table was placed into an HTML file for easy viewing. We customized the webpage format using Bootstrap, and equipped the table with several fully functional filters that allows users to interact with our visualizations. 

In future efforts, we may need to modify the code to be more flexible with the user inputs. For e.g., all combinations of day, month, and year that result in a unique date shall be accepted in the code, i.e. 01/01/2010, 01/1/2010, 1/1/2010, etc are all the same and shall be treated the same.
